# Database copy function

The package contains a cloud function that copies all the data from one MongoDB Atlas Cluster to another.

## digest-fetch package

This package is a wrapper for the `fetch` package (similar to `axios`).

`fetch` allows us to make API requests,
 while `digest-fetch` allows us to make use of the digest authentication flow used by the Atlas API.
