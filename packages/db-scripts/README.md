# Scripts

Scripts allow us to run batch operations on our database. Make sure you know what you're doing since scripts can modify the database in unwanted ways.

For information on how to write, test and deploy scripts, read the doc [Database Script Testing Procedure](https://github.com/flatten-official/flatten-somalia/blob/master/docs/Database%20Script%20Testing%20Procedure.md).
