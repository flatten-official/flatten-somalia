# COVID-19 Backend

Backend for the COVID-19 project

## Prerequisites

If you haven't already installed Node, please get that setup:

We highly recommend that you use nvm to make sure that we are all using the same node and npm versions across the field.

Installation link can be found here for

- [Unix/Linux](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
- [Windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows)

If you'd like to avoid the above package managers, you can install node [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/releases/), and make sure to select node versions above 10.18.1 (Latest version should be fine)

## Running

After making sure you have node and npm set up on your system, you can run `npm install` to get dependencies, and then `npm start` in the root directory to start the project.
